  <p>This a console app that leverages basic C# comands, datatypes and operations to take in user input for a mock program, that calculates which of two people have the higher income</p>

<h3 id="CarInsurance"><a href="https://github.com/Matssim/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance">Car Insurance App</a></h3>
  <p>This is an ASP.NET Core project leverages the MVC structure and MS Entity framework to compose a databse-driven web app that allows the user to enter information about a insuree and recieve a mock insurance quote.

There is also an admin view to track the insuree's personalia and their issued quote(s)</p>

  <p>This is a console app that leverages basic C# comands, datatypes and operations to take in user input for a mock program, that determines whether a given profile qualifies for insurance</p>

<h3 id="misc"><a href="https://github.com/Matssim/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Misc.%20Assignments%20and%20Challenges">Miscellaneous Assignments and Challenges</a></h3>
  <p>This is not a single project per say, but a directory of files created for various assignments and challenges during the C# and .NET course. It includes files that leverage basic and advanced C# functions.</p>

  <p>This is a code first console app that leverages the MS Entity framework to create a mock database that takes in input on students information and stores them as database objects</p>

<h3 id="TwentyOne"><a href="https://github.com/Matssim/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/TwentyOne">Twentyone Game</a></h3>
  <p>This is a console app building on various C# comands, datatypes and operations that makes a basic twentyone/blackjack game. It also contains a separte class library structure that allows for other games to reuse parts of the code</p>
